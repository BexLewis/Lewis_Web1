  <h1>About Us</h1>
</header>

<section>
  <p>WebsiteChef is a tight-knit group of experienced designers and developers with a
    passion for creating custom websites. For years now, we see people spending
    a lot of money on websites that aren't even custom made.
    Just some template that is being (minimally) customized as if it were their own.
    We want you to know we don't take part in this.
    We think everyone should have the opportunity to have a custom website,
    built by professionals, at an affordable price.</p>

    <h3> Ellen Alphenaar </h3>
      <p> For my event agency, I often need a website for a new event. Websitechef
       always makes sure I can launch quickly, make it look just the way I want
       it to while still being very affordable. I found myself a perfect business partner!
       </p>

  <h3> Fred Verloop</h3> <h5><a href="#"> View Website</a></h5>
      <p> My driving-school really needed some help getting online.
        Websitechef built me a beautiful, fast and well functioning website.
        I've already acquired multiple new students through my new website so
        you will believe me when I say I'm thrilled!</p>
